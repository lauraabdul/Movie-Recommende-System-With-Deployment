# Movie-Recommender-System-With-Deployment
## Introduction 
This project is a simple Movie recommender as a MachineLearning application 
*The recommender takes the official name of the movie as an input and gives you 10 names for 10 movies that you will most probably like*

## Description
* Using metadata for 5000 movies from TDMB  : [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
* Using Machine learning libs specifically **sklearn** , Pandas 
* preprocessing the data 
* Generating a doc column for each movie containing : genres , keywords , cast ,director and production company
* Using Cosine Similarity score between movies's docs 
* Making a **Flask** web application 
* Deploying the project onto **Heroku** cloud

## How to use it 
* Make sure to write the official release name of the movie 
* Data is only for movies before 2016

## Future potential upgrades 
* Using deeplearning Neural Network instead of the cosine similarity algo 
* Making an intelligent search engine
